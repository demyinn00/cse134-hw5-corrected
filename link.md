### PART 1 Files and Notes
For this part, all the meat and potatoes of the request handling is actually in handlers.js instead of methodtest.js. I wanted to modularize the code. 

In other words, methodtest.js simply creates a form to take input and then calls the respective request handlers.

script.js is just a script that the methodtest.html file will call.

### PART 3 (EXTRA CREDIT) Files and Notes
I used react to implement the button. I also needed to create a .babel file and npm install react which gave me node_modules. I don't think it's worth including them since it's all just configuration files to set up react.
